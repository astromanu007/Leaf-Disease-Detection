## 🚀 Overview

Leaf Disease Prediction with Cure is an 🤖 AI-powered application designed to detect plant leaf diseases and suggest appropriate treatments. Using deep learning models, the app helps farmers and gardeners 🌾 identify diseases from images of leaves and provides solutions to address these problems.

This project is developed using React for the frontend, TensorFlow.js for machine learning, and Node.js for backend services.

## 💡 Features
- 🔮 **AI-based Leaf Disease Detection**: Upload a leaf image, and the app will predict the disease.
- 👩‍🌾 **Cure Suggestions**: Provides appropriate remedies for the detected diseases.
- 🌐 **User-friendly Interface**: Simple, clean, and responsive UI.
- ⏱️ **Real-time Performance**: Quick and efficient predictions.
- 🛠️ **Cross-platform Support**: Works on web and mobile browsers.

## 🚪 Setup Instructions

### 🚀 Requirements
- 🧪 Node.js (v14 or above)
- 📅 NPM (v6 or above)
- 🛋️ MongoDB
- 🤖 TensorFlow.js

### 📜 Step-by-step Guide:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/astromanu007/Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
    cd leaf-disease-prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
    ```

4. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **Run the backend server**:
    In a separate terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory and start the backend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run server
    ```

6. **Access the app**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Upload a Leaf Image**: 🖼️ Take a clear photo of the leaf and upload it using the "Upload Image" button.
2. **View Predictions**: 🤖 The app will display the detected disease along with confidence levels.
3. **Get Cure Suggestions**: 🧪 Based on the prediction, the app will suggest potential treatments or remedies.
4. **Save History**: 📂 You can view and manage previous predictions through the app's history feature.
