#  üåø Anjaneya Plant Disease Detection & Cure

* Welcome to our innovative Plant Disease Detection system, a vital tool for modern agriculture. We've developed an advanced solution using Deep Learning technology that enables farmers to identify plant diseases quickly and accurately. Our system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks built with PyTorch to classify plant leaf images into 39 distinct disease categories. The model was trained on the comprehensive Plant Village dataset, which you can find linked in our Blog section.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.8** installed on your system
   - You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Verify installation by running `python --version` in terminal

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/astromanu007/Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Leaf-Disease-Detection
   ```

2. Set up Python Virtual Environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - For Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install Required Dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download Pre-trained Model
   - Get `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JsUW38lrsyAYG0ORjqwQxQiRZpPIoc0c/view?usp=sharing)
   - Place it in the `Flask Deployed App` directory

5. Run the Application
   ```
   cd Flask\ Deployed\ App
   python app.py
   ```

6. Access the Application
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - You're ready to start detecting plant diseases!

### Optional: Explore in Jupyter Notebook
- Navigate to the `Model` directory
- Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the model implementation
